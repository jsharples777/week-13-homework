# Project Description
This small command line interface (CLI) application will prompt the user to navigate a simple menu to organise departments, roles within those
departments, and employees working with those roles (with/without a manager).  By using the items in the main menu the user can view all departments,
view all roles, view all employees, show the employees for a given role, show the employees for a given department, and show the annual salary budget for all
departments.  

The user can also add a new department, role with a department, and add a new employee to a role with a manager.

The user can update the role of an employee after creation if desired.
